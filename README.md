# Bug Tracker - Redux, Node.js

A bug tracker... xyz. This project is based on [Mosh's Redux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQXNp9ItL4) on YouTube.

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It can be used with vanilla JavaScript and many frameworks, including React. It is typically useful for applications with complex UI and the need to keep data between the many components in sync.

All application state is stored in a central repository, a JavaScript object called the Store. The store is a single source of truth.

Redux's architecture makes it easy to diagnose where and how data changes in the application changes. It makes data flow transparent and predictable.
